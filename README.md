# Cloud-WebApplicationForMachineLearningAlgorithms
Web Application that runs different annotation generating machine learning algorithms on a single platform.

The project 'Cloud-Web Application' is a platform to run the annotation generating machine learning algorithms. This application takes an image as a user input and generates different types annotations as an output. The application is named 'Conjugate' as it provides a single web-based platform to run different annotation generating algorithms. Using this application, we can generate labels, detect faces, and detect objects for the input images. This application reduces the execution cost of the machine learning algorithms which uses GPU, large storage (hard disk), large capacity of RAM by resource sharing. This application has a future scope to integrate different annotation generating algorithms such as line annotation, and key point annotation and facilitate researchers to add their algorithms to this application. Furthermore, there is a scope to upgrade this application to a public platform to run any machine learning algorithm.
